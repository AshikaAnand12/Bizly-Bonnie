# Bizly-Bonnie

### Tasks :
1. Design a page that gives the user details about a restaurant. If a user clicks on the “Customize with Bonnie” button, it should take the user to the Chat page
2. Build a chatbot called “Bonnie” that asks relevant questions and acknowledges the answers given by the user.

### Features
1. Prebuild Dialog flow between the user and the Chatbot as per the Mockups shared
2. Responds to combination of words
3. Lists and images as the response from Bonnie

### Advancements
1. Easy to integrate with any fixed dialog flow - so we can add a static dialog flow
2. Easy to integrate with an ML model - add with an API

### For Local Setup
1. Download the files
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
